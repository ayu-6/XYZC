## ðŸš€ Usage

Here's a quick example of how to create a styled label:

```csharp
using XYZC.Components;
using XYZC.Core;

// Simple centered label with color
new Label("Hello, [color cyan]XYZC[color reset]!")
{
    TextAlign = TextAlign.Center
}.Draw();
```

For more complex UIs, you can use a `ConsoleScene` to manage multiple components.
